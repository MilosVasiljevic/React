//////


it or test You would pass a function to this method, and the test runner would execute that function as a block of tests.

describe This optional method is for grouping any number of it or test statements.

expect This is the condition that the test needs to pass. It compares the received parameter to the matcher. It also gives you access to a number of matchers that let you validate different things. You can read more about it in the documentation.

mount This method renders the full DOM, including the child components of the parent component, in which we are running the tests.

shallow This renders only the individual components that we are testing. It does not render child components. This enables us to test components in isolation.
